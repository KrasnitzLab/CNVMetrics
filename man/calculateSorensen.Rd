\title{Calculate Sorensen metric}
\usage{
calculateSorensen(sample01, sample02)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample01}{a \code{GRanges} which contains a collection of 
genomic ranges representing copy number events for the first sample.}

\item{sample02}{a \code{GRanges} which contains a collection of 
genomic ranges representing copy number events for the second sample.}
}
\value{
a \code{numeric}, the value of the Sorensen metric. If
the metric cannot be calculated, \code{NA} is returned.
}
\description{
Calculate Sorensen metric using overlapping regions between 
two samples.
}
\details{
The method calculates the Sorensen metric using overlapping
regions between the samples. All regions present in both samples are used
for the calculation of the metric.

The Sorensen metric is calculated by dividing twice the size of 
the intersection by the sum of the size of the two sets. If the sum of
the size of the two sets is zero; the value \code{NA} is
returned instead. The strand of the regions is not taken into account while
calculating the intersection.
}
\examples{

## Load required package to generate the two samples
require(GenomicRanges)

## Generate two samples with identical sequence levels
sample01 <- GRanges(seqnames = "chr1", 
    ranges =  IRanges(start = c(1905048, 4554832, 31686841), 
    end = c(2004603, 4577608, 31695808)), strand =  "*")
sample02 <- GRanges(seqnames = "chr1", 
    ranges =  IRanges(start = c(1995066, 31611222), 
    end = c(2204505, 31689898)), strand =  "*")
