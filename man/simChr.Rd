\usage{
simChr(curSample, chrCur, nbSim)
}
\arguments{
\item{curSample}{a \code{GRanges} that contains a collection of
genomic ranges representing copy number events, including amplified/deleted
status, from exactly one sample. The sample must have a metadata column
called '\code{state}' with a state, in an character string format,
specified for each region (ex: DELETION, LOH, AMPLIFICATION, NEUTRAL, etc.)
and a metadata column called '\code{CN}' that contains the log2 copy
number ratios.}

\item{chrCur}{\code{character} string with the chromosome.}

\item{nbSim}{a single \code{integer} which is corresponding to the number
of simulations that will be generated.}
}
\value{
a code{list} containing one entry per simulation. Each entry is
a \code{data.frame} containing shuffled segments with 6 columns:
\itemize{
\item{\code{ID}}{ the name of the simulation }
\item{\code{chr}}{ the name fo the chromosome }
\item{\code{start}}{ the starting position of the segment; the positions
are between zero and one }
\item{\code{end}}{ the ending position of the segment; the positions
are between zero and one }
\item{\code{log2ratio}} { the log2 copy number ratio assigned to the segment
state: the state of the region (ex: DELETION, LOH, NEUTRAL, etc.) }
}

## Generates 10 shuffled chromosomes based on chromosome 2
## The shuffled chromosomes have a start and an end between 0 an 1

## Generates 4 shuffled chromosomes based on chromosome 1
## The shuffled chromosomes have a start and an end between 0 an 1
