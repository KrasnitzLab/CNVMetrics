\title{Generate common segments to enable calculation of metrics on 
two segmented samples.}
\usage{
createDisjoinSegmentsForTwoSamples(
  segmentDataSample1,
  segmentDataSample2,
  bedExclusion = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{segmentDataSample1}{a \code{GRanges}, the segments from the first 
sample.}

\item{segmentDataSample2}{a \code{GRanges}, the segments from the second 
sample.}

\item{bedExclusion}{a \code{GRanges}, the regions that must be
excluded from the analysis. Default: \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
a \code{GRanges} containing the common segment information for the
two samples. The log2ration value are present, for the two samples, in 
the metadata columns. When there is not log2ratio value for one sample, 
NA is the assigned value. A metadata column also specifies if the segments
should be included in the analysis.
}
\description{
The two segments are gathered together, including excluded 
regions when specified, and a disjoint operation is done to create a 
collection of non-overlapping ranges. The ranges overlapping the excluded 
regions are marked as so to be removed from future analysis. The log2value
of each samples are assigned to the new disjointed segments for each sample
in the metadata columns.
}
\examples{

## Load required package to generate the two samples
require(GenomicRanges)

# Create first Granges representing first sample
sample01 <- GRanges(seqnames="chr1",
    ranges =  IRanges(start=c(100, 201, 400), end=c(200, 350, 500)),
    strand =  "*", log2ratio=c(0.3091175, 0.4582058, -0.3798390))

# Create second Granges representing second sample
sample02 <- GRanges(seqnames="chr1",
    ranges=IRanges(start=c(150, 200, 450), end=c(250, 350, 500)),
    strand="*", log2ratio=c(0.222174, 0.3282156, -0.2728292))

# Create disjoint segment using the 2 samples and without any region
# excluded from the analysis (parameter bedExclusion set to null)

    segmentDataSample2=sample02, bedExclusion=NULL)
