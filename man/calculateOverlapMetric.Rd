\title{Calculate metric using overlapping amplified/deleted regions}
\usage{
calculateOverlapMetric(
  segmentData,
  method = c("sorensen", "szymkiewicz", "jaccard")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{segmentData}{a \code{GRangesList} that contains a collection of 
genomic ranges representing copy number events, including amplified/deleted 
status, from at least 2 samples. All samples must have a metadata column 
called '\code{state}' with amplified regions identified as 
'\code{AMPLIFICATION}' and deleted regions identified as '\code{DELETION}'; 
regions with different identifications will not be used in the
calculation of the metric.}

\item{method}{a \code{character} string representing the metric to be used. 
This should be (an unambiguous abbreviation of) one of "sorensen", 
"szymkiewicz" or "jaccard". Default: "sorensen".}
}
\value{
an object of class "\code{CNVMetric}" which contains the calculated
metric. This object is a list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item{\code{AMPLIFICATION}}{ a lower-triangular \code{matrix} with the 
    results of the selected metric on the amplified regions for each paired
    samples. The value \code{NA} is present when the metric cannot be 
    calculated. The value \code{NA} is also present in the top-triangular 
    section, as well as the diagonal, of the matrix.
 }
 \item{\code{DELETION}}{ a lower-triangular \code{matrix} with the 
    results of the selected metric on the deleted regions for each paired
    samples. The value \code{NA} is present when the metric cannot be 
    calculated. The value \code{NA} is also present in the top-triangular 
    section, as well as the diagonal, of the matrix.
}}

The object has the following attributes (besides "class" equal 
to "CNVMetric"):
\itemize{
\item{\code{metric}}{ the metric used for the calculation.
 } 
\item{\code{names}}{ the names of the two matrix containing the metrics for
the amplified and deleted regions.
}}
}
\description{
Calculate a specific metric using overlapping 
amplified/deleted regions between to samples. The metric is calculated for
the amplified and deleted regions separately. When more than 2 samples are 
present, the metric is calculated for each sample pair.
}
\details{
The two methods each estimate the overlap between paired samples. They use 
different metrics, all in the range [0, 1] with 0 indicating no overlap.

The available metrics are (written for two GRanges):

\code{sorensen}:

This metric is calculated by dividing twice the size of the intersection 
by the sum of the size of the two sets. 
With this metric, an overlap metric value of 1 is only obtained when the
two samples are identical. 

\code{szymkiewicz}:

This metric is calculated by dividing the size of the intersection 
by the size of the smallest set. With this metric, if one set is a 
subset of the other set, the overlap metric value is 1.

\code{jaccard}:

This metric is calculated by dividing the size of the intersection 
by the size of the union of the two sets. With this metric, an overlap 
metric value of 1 is only obtained when the two samples are identical.

## Load required package to generate the samples
require(GenomicRanges)

## Create a GRangesList object with 3 samples
## The stand of the regions doesn't affect the calculation of the metric
demo <- GRangesList()
demo[["sample01"]] <- GRanges(seqnames = "chr1", 
    ranges =  IRanges(start = c(1905048, 4554832, 31686841), 
    end = c(2004603, 4577608, 31695808)), strand =  "*",
    state = c("AMPLIFICATION", "AMPLIFICATION", "DELETION"))

    end = c(2204505, 31689898, 31895666)), strand =  c("-", "+", "+"),
    state = c("AMPLIFICATION", "AMPLIFICATION", "DELETION"))

## The amplified region in sample03 is a subset of the amplified regions 
## in sample01
