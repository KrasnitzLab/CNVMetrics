\title{Calculate Szymkiewicz-Simpson metric}
\usage{
calculateSzymkiewicz(sample01, sample02)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample01}{a \code{GRanges} which contains a collection of 
genomic ranges representing copy number events for the first sample.}

\item{sample02}{a \code{GRanges} which contains a collection of 
genomic ranges representing copy number events for the second sample.}
}
\value{
a \code{numeric}, the value of the Szymkiewicz-Simpson metric. If
the metric cannot be calculated, \code{NA} is returned.
}
\description{
Calculate Szymkiewicz-Simpson metric using overlapping 
regions between two samples.
}
\details{
The method calculates the Szymkiewicz-Simpson metric using overlapping
regions between the samples. All regions present in both samples all used
for the calculation of the metric.

The Szymkiewicz-Simpson metric is calculated by dividing the size of 
the intersection by the smaller of the size of the two sets. If one sample
has a size of zero, the metric is not calculated; the value \code{NA} is
returned instead. The strand of the regions is not taken into account while
calculating the intersection.

\examples{

## Load required package to generate the two samples
require(GenomicRanges)

## Generate two samples with identical sequence levels
sample01 <- GRanges(seqnames = "chr1", 
    ranges =  IRanges(start = c(1905048, 4554832, 31686841), 
    end = c(2004603, 4577608, 31695808)), strand =  "*")
sample02 <- GRanges(seqnames = "chr1", 
    ranges =  IRanges(start = c(1995066, 31611222), 
    end = c(2204505, 31689898)), strand =  c("+", "-"))
