\arguments{
\item{curSample}{a \code{GRangesList} that contains a collection of 
genomic ranges representing copy number events, including amplified/deleted 
status, from at least 1 samples. The sample must have a metadata column 
called '\code{state}' with a state, in an character string format, 
specified for each region (ex: DELETION, LOH, AMPLIFICATION, NEUTRAL, etc.).}

\item{nbSim}{a \code{integer} which is corresponding to the number of simulation}
