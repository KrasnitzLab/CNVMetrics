\title{CNVMetrics: Copy number variant metrics}
\description{
The CNVMetrics package calculates similarity metrics to facilitate copy 
number variant comparison among samples and/or methods. Some metrics are 
based on the shared amplified/deleted regions while other metrics rely on 
the level of amplification/deletion. Finally, a visualization tool is 
provided to explore resulting metrics.
