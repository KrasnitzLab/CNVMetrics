\title{Calculate metric using overlapping amplified/deleted regions between 
samples.}
\usage{
calculateOverlapRegionsMetric(
  segmentData,
  method = c("sorensen", "szymkiewicz")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{segmentData}{a \code{GRangesList} that contains the segment 
information, including amplified/deleted status, from at least 2 samples.}

\item{method}{a \code{character} string representing the metric to be used. 
This should be (an unambiguous abbreviation of) one of "sorensen" or 
"szymkiewicz-simpson". Default: "sorensen".}

\value{
a \code{matrix} TODO
}
\description{
Calculate a specific metric using overlapping regions between
to samples. When more than 2 samples are present, the metric is calculated
for each sample pair.
}
\details{
Available distance measures are (written for two Granges x and y):
