Title: Copy Number Variant Metrics
Description: The CNVMetrics package calculates similarity metrics to 
    facilitate copy number variant comparison among samples and/or methods. 
    Some metrics are based on the shared amplified/deleted regions while other 
    metrics rely on the level of amplification/deletion. Finally, 
    a visualization tool is provided to explore resulting metrics.
