Title: Copy Number Variant Metrics
Description: The CNVMetrics package calculates similarity metrics to 
    facilitate copy number variant comparison among samples and/or methods. 
    Similarity metrics can be employed to compare CNV profiles of genetically 
    unrelated samples as well as those with a common genetic background. 
    Some metrics are based on the shared amplified/deleted regions while other 
    metrics rely on the level of amplification/deletion. 
    The data type used as input is a plain text file containing the genomic 
    position of the copy number variations, as well as the status and/or 
    the log2 ratio values.
    Finally, a visualization tool is provided to explore resulting metrics.
